The Great Recession\n  of 2008 has had huge and long-lasting impacts on the economies of both\n  the developed and developing countries. Political crises ensued, as a\n  result of these crises, as evidenced by the recent political\n  polarisation, and democracy regression around the globe. The recent\n  pandemic has unmasked the extent of the inequality, poverty, and social\n  exclusion among populations around the world. These crises also happen\n  within the existing ‘‘grand’’ climate and sustainability challenges. It\n  is against this background that the theme of the Conference on Public\n  Innovation, Development and Sustainability is centred on innovation and\n  how it can respond to the recent crises. Concepts such as “innovation\n  for development”, “information and communication technology (ICT) for\n  development”, “digital economies”, and “artificial intelligence” (AI)\n  are being increasingly used in academic and policy discourses. The idea\n  of innovation for development (I4D) has now been entrenched within\n  countries and international development organisations.\n  </p>\n  \n  <p style=\"color: white; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; word-wrap: break-word\">\n  In trying to tackle the grand societal challenges through innovation, some scholars and policymakers have recently called for\n  mission-oriented innovation. Previously, innovation debates were centred on Research and Development (R&D), mainly to\n  enhance the productivity of firms (Hekkert et al., 2020). The aim of the state in driving the innovation agenda, was to strengthen\n  national systems of innovation for national economic growth (Schot and Steinmueller, 2018). However, missions-oriented\n  innovation centres the notion of public value in its design and aim to create a pathway to different ways of working across\n  the public sector and creating better public value for citizens (OECD, 2022). Conceptualising innovation and development\n  through a ‘‘missions’’ lens has several advantages and offers a range of opportunities. First, the proposed policy solutions\n  (for example, SDGs) to grand challenges require cross-sectoral and multiple-actors collaboration. Second, mission-oriented\n  innovation calls for the transformation of the state and the public sector, and the re-orientation of the state to shape innovation\n  for public value. It is against this background that we invite high quality submissions on public innovation, development, and\n  sustainability for presentation at a two-day conference on Public Innovation, Development and Sustainability. We encourage\n  researchers, academics, public officials, private sector, and civil society to send through submissions.
